# Under Water Passibe Acoustic Source Localization

We developed a model to track distances of the sea floor. 
The processed dataset is too large to store in github so we are storing it in a shared drive that can handle its compressed size (12.5 Gb) here: 

[SW96_CSDM.zip](https://drexel0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nh585_drexel_edu/EetAsTAddv1NkG7vvt8LyzMBzpbld3eytqdwNIMFJz6APA?e=4pYVsr) 

Please download it and uncompress it and add it to the same folder as your **PassiveSonarUnderWaterDetection** cloned repo or forked branch lives locally. 


## How the training works

There is a script called **Training.py** (TODO)
